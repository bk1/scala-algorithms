/**
 * Implements an example of Insertion Sort.
 *
 * In English, here's how the algorithm works:
 * Moving left to right, evaluate each new value against those to its left,
 * all of which are already sorted. Move this value leftwards until it too is
 * sorted, then move on to the next. At any point in the iteration, all 
 * elements to the left are already sorted, and an unsorted subset exists
 * to the right.
