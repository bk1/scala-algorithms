/**
 * Implements an example of Bubble sort.
 *
 * In English, here's how the algorithm works:
 * Moving left to right, compare two adjacent elements. If they are out of
 * order, swap them, then move one element to the right and repeat. Repeat
 * this whole exercise until the entire list is sorted. Note that, over time,
 * the greatest values race to the right and the unsorted subarray becomes
 * truncated. The final iteration only compares the leftmost pair.
