# Insertion Sort

##Summary:  
Insertion sort is a simple, in-place comparison sort that exhibits O(n^2) behavior on average and worst case. Insertion sort is stable.

##Use Cases:
An inefficient sort, Insertion sort is most frequently used on very small datasets due to its low constants, and can be faster than quicksort in these cases. Best case performance O(n) occurs when sorting already-sorted or nearly-sorted data. This algorithm can sort stream data and requires O(n) space.
